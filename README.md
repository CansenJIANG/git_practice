## README.md file
The README.md file is a markdown file that can be read directly by the github. There are many tools that you can edit the markdown file, such as an [online editor](https://stackedit.io/editor). The markdown file has many formats just to display the README file more friendly. The cool thing is that it can be easily shown the content in a structured way without downloading it.  

## Git ignore file
The git .ignore file is to ignore some files that you don't need to track with git. For instance, if you are programming using c++ with Qt, you might need to add the following to the ignore file:

C++ objects and libs
*.slo 	*.lo	*.o	*.a 	*.la 	*.lai 	*.so	*.dll	*.dylib	  *.pro.user  *.pro.user.   *.qbs.user *.moc etc.

Also check the [.gitignore file](https://github.com/CansenJIANG/git_practice/blob/master/.gitignore) for more examples.
